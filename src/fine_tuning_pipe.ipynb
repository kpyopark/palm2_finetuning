I would be happy to have the statements for my two  \\nRetirement Accounts eDelivered but do want to continue to receive  \\nmy Personal Account in the mail. Is there any way I can do this ?\\nA. Yes! \\xa0Clients that receive an account link group statement package of \\ntwo or more accounts have the option to individually elect their delivery \\npreference for each account within the statement package. Enroll in \\neDelivery at www.morganstanley.com/edelivery. Once the statement is \\navailable, you will receive an email with a secure link to your statement. \\nThis is a great way to reduce the volume of paper you have to manage \\nand, since you do not have to wait for the mail, you will be able to view \\nyour statement as soon as it is ready. \\xa0\\nQ. What does trade date activity presentation mean ?\\nA. Historically there have been two approaches to displaying security \\ntransactions, and the impact on your account:\\n•  Settlement Date\\u2009—\\u2009Displaying only those transactions that have  \\n“settled” within the current statement period; or\\n•  Trade Date\\u2009—\\u2009Displaying all trades executed within the current  \\nstatement period, regardless of whether or not they have settled.\\nIn the past, when clients purchased or sold a position at the end of the \\nmonth, they had to wait until the next statement to see the impact of the \\ntrade. Morgan\\xa0Stanley uses a trade date activity presentation in order to \\nreflect the impact of all trades executed through the last business day of \\nthe month and, to align with both performance and cost basis reporting.\\nQ. How are unsettled trades represented on my statement?\\nA. Any position bought or sold, regardless of whether or not it has \\nsettled, will appear in (or, be removed from) the HOLDINGS section \\nof your statement. Since neither monies nor securities are due to the \\ncontra side until settlement date\\u2009—\\u2009there is no impact to cash, deposits \\nor money market funds until the trades settle. As a result, when an un -settled trade is included on your statement, you will see Net Unsettled \\nPurchases\\u2009/\\u2009Sales in the BALANCE SHEET and CASH FLOW summary \\nsections so that the Total Value is not over (or under) stated .\\nQ. What are the Estimated Annual Income and Current Yield that are \\ndisplayed in the HOLDINGS section of my statement and how are they \\ndifferent from the information in the Income Summary ?\\nA. Estimated Annual Income is a projection of future income and the \\nIncome Summary section is a recap of the income actually credited to \\nyour account during the current statement period and year-to-date .\\nThe Estimated Annual Income  which appears in the HOLDINGS is based \\nupon the dividend or interest expected to be received over the next \\ntwelve months. Generally, for equities, it is the most recent dividend  \\n(per-share) times the payment frequency, times the number of shares or \\nunits held. Current Yield  is then calculated by dividing the total estimated \\nannual income by the current market value of the entire position. For \\nsecurities that have a defined maturity date within the next 12 months, \\nthe Estimated Annual Income calculation will be adjusted to reflect \\nincome only through maturity date.\\nFor example:\\nNumber  \\nof  \\nSharesCurrent  \\nShare \\nPriceMost  \\nRecent  \\nDividend  \\nAmountDividend  \\nPayment  \\nFrequency \\n(Quarterly)Estimated  \\nAnnual \\nIncomeCurrent  \\nMarket  \\nValue of the \\nEntire  \\nPositionCurrent \\nYield\\n100 $15.00 .25 4 $100.00  $1500.00 6.7%\\nMutual fund Estimated Annual Income  is based upon historical distribu -\\ntions over the preceding 12-month period, rather than on the most recent ' metadata={'source': '../resources/Guide to Reading Your Morgan Stanley Statement.pdf', 'page': 18}\n",

What’s the difference between Unrealized Gain / (Loss) and  \\nRealized Gain / (Loss)?\\nA. Unrealized Gain\\u2009/(Loss) presents the potential gain or loss if you were \\nto have sold a security at the price displayed on your statement. Unreal -\\nized Gain/(Loss) does not include commissions or fees that may apply to \\nproceeds upon the final sale of the security.\\nGains or losses are considered realized when the position is actually sold, \\nand the details (which would include the impact of all commissions and/\\nor fees) are presented in a separate section on your statement.\\nQ. In my summary sections, why do I only see one number for Unrealized \\nGain / (Loss), but I see “This Period”/ “This Year” for Realized Gain/ (Loss) ?\\nA. Generally speaking, Realized Gain/(Loss) is reportable in the year the \\ntrade is made. For the positions that you currently own and for which there \\nhas been no reportable event (e.g., a sale), we display unrealized Gain /\\n(Loss) information from acquisition date to the present, in the Consoli -\\ndated Summary and Account Summary as well as in the HOLDINGS.\\nQ. What is the difference between all of the cost terms ?\\nA. Total Cost  (also known as Cost Basis) represents the amount paid for \\nthe security, including commissions and fees if applicable, and excluding \\naccrued interest on fixed income purchases. Total Cost  may differ from \\nthe net amount on the trade confirmation (e.g., for fixed income trades), \\nas the net amount paid could include accrued interest paid to the seller \\n(or received from the buyer).\\nUnit Cost represents the per-share amount paid for the security, including  \\ncommissions and fees if applicable and excluding accrued interest on \\nfixed income purchases.Frequently Asked Questions (continued)\\ndividend. Current Yield for both open-end mutual funds and non-sweep \\nmoney market funds is then calculated by dividing the total estimated \\nannual income by the current market value of the entire position. For \\nsweep money market funds, the Current Yield refers to a simple annualized \\nyield (net of fees) for an identified seven-calendar-day period. The Annual \\nPercentage Yield (APY) for Bank Deposits represents the applicable rate \\nin effect for your deposits at the statement ending date. This APY may be \\ndifferent than the APY that was in effect during the statement period.\\nQ. What is the relationship between Share Price and Market Value ?\\nA. Share Price of the securities displayed on the statement is obtained \\nfrom various sources. For securities that are listed on an exchange or \\nwhich trade continually in an active marketplace, the Share Price reflects \\nthe closing price as of the last business day of your statement period. For \\nsecurities that trade less frequently, the price generally reflects the bid \\nprice if it is available. Fixed income prices are provided by outside pric -\\ning services and/or computerized pricing models, which do not always \\nprovide actual market values and may be based on recent transactions \\nor bids, or estimates. For Mutual Funds, the Share Price is the fund’s \\nNet Asset Value (NAV) at the end of the day. Depending upon the secu -\\nrity type, the share price label may vary, e.g., contract price for options, \\nunit price for bonds. Your Expanded Disclosures contain more detail on \\npricing and account valuations .\\nMarket Value  is generally derived by multiplying the Share Price times \\nthe Quantity . For certain securities (such as Collateralized Mortgage \\nObligations), there is another component, the Factor, which is also part \\nof the equation. The factor reflects the remaining principal balance of a \\nmortgage security and it changes after each principal payment.\\nQ. What's the difference between Capital Gains  and Capital  \\nGains Distributions?\\nA. A Capital Gain is a profit between the security's adjusted cost basis \\nand the price at which it is sold. A Capital Gains Distribution is a mutual \" metadata={'source': '../resources/Guide to Reading Your Morgan Stanley Statement.pdf', 'page': 19}\n",

For fixed income securities, the majority of adjustments to \\ncost basis are either amortization of the premium (the amount you paid \\nfor a bond in excess of its face value) at purchase, or the accretion of \\noriginal issue discount (OID) or market discount. Whether you choose \\nto amortize the premium on non-municipal bonds or not, the pertinent \\ninformation is readily available.\\n•  Amortization is an accounting procedure that reduces the cost basis \\nof a bond by the amount of any premium (the amount in excess of \\npar) paid for the bond. Cost basis of the bond will be decreased daily \\nuntil it is equal to its face value at maturity date (or earlier call date). \\nMorgan\\xa0Stanley amortizes premiums paid on both tax-exempt and \\ntaxable bonds. And, although the premium on a tax-exempt bond must \\nbe amortized, clients may use this information or elect not to do so \\nfor taxable bonds.\\n•  Accretion refers to the daily process of increasing your original \\ncost basis by the Original Issue Discount (OID) that accrues on the \\nbond until the sale or redemption of the bond. IRS regulations re -\\nquire the holder to report OID as it accrues over the term of the debt  \\ninstrument whether or not you receive any payments from the issuer. If you purchase the bond at original issue and hold it to maturity, the \\nbasis upon maturity will have increased to the face amount. We use \\nthe constant yield method, also referred to as the economic accrual \\nmethod, for both municipal and taxable fixed income securities.\\nCost basis may also be adjusted for other securities. For equities, the \\nbasis must be adjusted for certain events that occur after purchase. For \\nexample, if you receive additional stock from non-taxable stock dividends \\nor stock splits, the basis of your original shares is reduced. Similarly, \\nbasis is reduced when you receive non-dividend distributions, such as a \\nnon-taxable return of capital (up to the amount of your basis).\\nQ. What do you mean when you say “accounts subject to tax reporting?”\\nA. Accounts subject to tax reporting are those accounts for which we are \\nrequired to provide an IRS Form 1099 for US accounts and form 1042-S \\nfor foreign accounts. Certain accounts are exempt from our reporting \\nrequirements (though these accounts may have reporting requirements \\nof their own). These include, among others, corporate, tax-exempt orga -\\nnizations, IRA and retirement accounts.\\nQ. What is Accrued Interest and how does it impact my account?\\nA. Accrued Interest  is the estimated amount of interest that would be \\nincluded in the total amount received upon the sale of a fixed income \\nposition; and is calculated from the date of the last coupon payment (or \\ndated date) through the closing date of the statement. Since the value of \\nyour fixed income positions includes the interest that accrues every day, \\nthis provides a comprehensive valuation of your account. The Accrued \\nInterest  is shown in HOLDINGS  for each fixed income security, as well \\nas on the BALANCE SHEET (where it is included in the overall value \\nof each fixed income product type).Frequently Asked Questions (continued)' metadata={'source': '../resources/Guide to Reading Your Morgan Stanley Statement.pdf', 'page': 20}\n",
      "page_content='Q. What is Accrued Interest You Paid and Accrued Interest Received?\\nA. Accrued Interest You Paid  is that portion of a bond purchase that \\nrepresents the interest which will be given to the seller of the bond on \\nnext coupon payable date. As the new owner of the bond, the purchaser \\nwill receive the entire coupon payment even if it has not been owned for \\nthe full period. This amount is part of the total transaction cost but not \\npart of the bond’s cost basis.\\nOn the other hand, when a client sells a bond, Accrued Interest Received  \\nrepresents the interest that has accrued since the last coupon payable \\ndate and to which the client is entitled. And, although part of the total \\ntransaction proceeds, Accrued Interest You Paid is not a part of the pro -\\nceeds for the purposes of gain/(loss) calculation.\\nQ. My bonds seem to be in a random order. Are they in any order?\\nA. Bonds are presented by maturity or pre-refunding date if earlier, and \\nthen alphabetically within date.\\nQ. What’s the difference between the Balance Sheet categories and those \\ndisplayed on the Asset Allocation pie chart and table?\\nA. The BALANCE SHEET presents your positions grouped into a variety \\nof product categories (e.g., Stocks, Mutual Funds, Municipal Bonds, etc.). \\nThe ASSET ALLOCATION pie chart (or, bar chart, if the account has \\na debit or short position), takes the market value of these positions and \\nallocates them across one or more of the following Asset Classes: Cash, \\nEquities, Fixed Income & Preferreds, Alternatives, Structured Invest -\\nments or Other. For certain products (e.g., Mutual Funds, Unit Investment \\nTrusts, Exchange-Traded & Closed-End Funds), the value of the position \\ncould be split across more than one asset class. For instance, the value \\nof a balanced mutual fund could be split into Equities and Fixed Income \\n& Preferreds. Keep in mind that Asset Allocation is the organization of Frequently Asked Questions (continued)\\ninvestments by Morgan\\xa0Stanley Wealth Management based on various \\ncharacteristics, such as risk, volatility and correlation to other invest -\\nments, and as a result may differ from the classification of the underlying \\nsecurity for regulatory purposes or its taxable status, and may differ from \\nthe Product Level display in the Balance Sheet classification.\\nQ. I see the words “acted as agent” and “acted as principal” next to trades. \\nWhat do these terms mean?\\nA. These phrases explain in which capacity the firm acted when executing \\na trade on behalf of a client. “Acted as Agent” means that Morgan\\xa0Stan -\\nley acts in the “capacity” of an agent on behalf of our clients in a trade, \\ngoing out to the marketplace to fill orders. “Acted as Principal” means \\nthat Morgan\\xa0Stanley sells to a client out of the Firm’s inventory, or as \\npart of a new issue IPO.\\nQ. In the cash flow section of my Account Summary, I see lines for “Other \\nCredits” and “Other Debits.” What are these?\\nA. These terms refer to funds coming into or out of an account. Among \\nother activity, these can be the results of account transfers, deposits, \\noption premiums/exercises, and/or account service fees (including  \\nAdvisory fees).\\nQ. Why does my pie chart show that I hold Alternatives, when I haven’t \\nbought any Alternative Investment products?\\nA. Allocations to the Alternatives Asset Class will occur for funds with \\na non-traditional investment style. Non-traditional funds include those \\nthat pursue strategies that diverge from conventional practices in the \\nbond- or equity-fund universes. REITs and Energy-focused MLPs, as \\nwell as funds with a focus on those investments, are also classified as \\nAlternatives. The Firm classifies funds based on their investment objec -\\ntive, and not by looking at their underlying holdings.\\n© 2020 Morgan\\xa0Stanley Smith\\xa0Barney LLC. Member SIPC.

Han-era Daoists assembled into small groups of hermits who attempted to achieve immortality through breathing exercises, sexual techniques and use of medical elixirs. By the 2nd century AD, Daoists formed large hierarchical religious societies such as the Way of the Five Pecks of Rice. Its followers believed that the sage-philosopher Laozi (fl. 6th century BC) was a holy prophet who would offer salvation and good health if his devout followers would confess their sins, ban the worship of unclean gods who accepted meat sacrifices and chant sections of the Daodejing. question: What could be earned if an individual had reached the lands of the Queen Mother of the West?   \n",

There is \"little coherent relationship between the amount and mix of homosexual and heterosexual behavior in a person's biography and that person's choice to label himself or herself as bisexual, homosexual, or heterosexual\". Individuals typically experience diverse attractions and behaviors that may reflect curiosity, experimentation, social pressure and is not necessarily indicative of an underlying sexual orientation. For example, a woman may have fantasies or thoughts about sex with other women but never act on these thoughts and only have sex with opposite gender partners. If sexual orientation was being assessed based on one's sexual attraction then this individual would be considered homosexual, but her behavior indicates heterosexuality. question: What do individuals typically experience?   \n",

Victoria felt \"sick at heart\" to see her daughter leave England for Germany; \"It really makes me shudder\", she wrote to Princess Victoria in one of her frequent letters, \"when I look round to all your sweet, happy, unconscious sisters, and think I must give them up too – one by one.\" Almost exactly a year later, Princess Victoria gave birth to the Queen's first grandchild, Wilhelm, who would become the last German Kaiser. question: How old was Victoria's oldest daughter when she was amrried?   \n",

       "179422  context: Very small lamps may have the filament support wires extended through the base of the lamp, and can be directly soldered to a printed circuit board for connections. Some reflector-type lamps include screw terminals for connection of wires. Most lamps have metal bases that fit in a socket to support the lamp and conduct current to the filament wires. In the late 19th century, manufacturers introduced a multitude of incompatible lamp bases. General Electric introduced standard base sizes for tungsten incandescent lamps under the Mazda trademark in 1909. This standard was soon adopted across the US, and the Mazda name was used by many manufacturers under license through 1945. Today most incandescent lamps for general lighting service use an Edison screw in candelabra, intermediate, or standard or mogul sizes, or double contact bayonet base. Technical standards for lamp bases include ANSI standard C81.67 and IEC standard 60061-1 for common commercial lamp sizes, to ensure interchangeablitity between different manufacturer's products. Bayonet base lamps are frequently used in automotive lamps to resist loosening due to vibration. A bipin base is often used for halogen or reflector lamps. question: Which company introduced standard base sizes for incandescent lamps?   \n",

After the Tito–Stalin split of 1948 and his inauguration as president in 1953, Tito rarely wore his uniform except when present in a military function, and then (with rare exception) only wore his Yugoslav ribbons for obvious practical reasons. The awards were displayed in full number only at his funeral in 1980.

It had a history of African slavery, although Britain abolished it decades before the US. Since the 20th century, there has been considerable immigration to Bermuda from the West Indies, as well as continued immigration from Portuguese Atlantic islands. Unlike immigrants from British colonies in the West Indies, the latter immigrants have had greater difficulty in becoming permanent residents as they lacked British citizenship, mostly spoke no English, and required renewal of work permits to remain beyond an initial period. From the 1950s onwards, Bermuda relaxed its immigration laws, allowing increased immigration from Britain and Canada. Some Black politicians accused the government of using this device to counter the West Indian immigration of previous decades. question: Why did the English originally colonize Bermuda?</td>\n",

In turn, Gaddafi played up his commercial relationship with the Soviets, visiting Moscow again in April 1981 and 1985, and threatening to join the Warsaw Pact. The Soviets were nevertheless cautious of Gaddafi, seeing him as an unpredictable extremist. Beginning military exercises in the Gulf of Sirte – an area of sea that Libya claimed as a part of its territorial waters – in August 1981 the U.S. shot down two Libyan Su-22 planes monitoring them. Closing down Libya's embassy in Washington, D.C., Reagan advised U.S. companies operating in the country to reduce the number of American personnel stationed there. In March 1982, the U.S. implemented an embargo of Libyan oil, and in January 1986 ordered all U.S. companies to cease operating in the country, although several hundred workers remained. Diplomatic relations also broke down with the U.K., after Libyan diplomats were accused in the shooting death of Yvonne Fletcher, a British policewoman stationed outside their London embassy, in April 1984. In Spring 1986, the U.S. Navy again began performing exercises in the Gulf of Sirte; the Libyan military retaliated, but failed as the U.S. sank several Libyan ships. question: What did Reagan wrongly believe Libya to be?</td>\n",

It had a history of African slavery, although Britain abolished it decades before the US. Since the 20th century, there has been considerable immigration to Bermuda from the West Indies, as well as continued immigration from Portuguese Atlantic islands. Unlike immigrants from British colonies in the West Indies, the latter immigrants have had greater difficulty in becoming permanent residents as they lacked British citizenship, mostly spoke no English, and required renewal of work permits to remain beyond an initial period. From the 1950s onwards, Bermuda relaxed its immigration laws, allowing increased immigration from Britain and Canada. Some Black politicians accused the government of using this device to counter the West Indian immigration of previous decades. question: Why did the English originally colonize Bermuda?   \n",

The English also employed longbowmen, but other countries were unable to create similar forces with the same success. Armour continued to advance, spurred by the increasing power of crossbows, and plate armour was developed to protect soldiers from crossbows as well as the hand-held guns that were developed. Pole arms reached new prominence with the development of the Flemish and Swiss infantry armed with pikes and other long spears. question: Along with crossbows, what was plate armor designed to defend against?   \n",

Queen were scheduled to headline Sonisphere at Knebworth on 7 July 2012 with Adam Lambert before the festival was cancelled. Queen's final concert with Freddie Mercury was in Knebworth in 1986. Brian May commented, \"It's a worthy challenge for us, and I'm sure Adam would meet with Freddie's approval.\" Queen expressed disappointment at the cancellation and released a statement to the effect that they were looking to find another venue. It was later announced that Queen + Adam Lambert would play two shows at the Hammersmith Apollo, London on 11 and 12 July 2012. Both shows sold out within 24 hours of tickets going on open sale. A third London date was scheduled for 14 July. On 30 June, Queen + Lambert performed in Kiev, Ukraine at a joint concert with Elton John for the Elena Pinchuk ANTIAIDS Foundation.

Born on Corsica as the French invaded, and dying suspiciously on the tiny British Island of St. Helena, this brilliant commander, controlled a French Empire that, at its height, ruled a large portion of Europe directly from Paris, while many of his friends and family ruled countries such as Spain, Poland, several parts of Italy and many other Kingdoms Republics and dependencies. The Napoleonic Era changed the face of Europe forever, and old Empires and Kingdoms fell apart as a result of the mighty and \"Glorious\" surge of Republicanism. question: From where did the French empire rule a large portion of Europe?   \n",
       "19  context: In 1981, the new US President Ronald Reagan pursued a hard line approach to Libya, erroneously considering it a puppet regime of the Soviet Union. In turn, Gaddafi played up his commercial relationship with the Soviets, visiting Moscow again in April 1981 and 1985, and threatening to join the Warsaw Pact. The Soviets were nevertheless cautious of Gaddafi, seeing him as an unpredictable extremist. Beginning military exercises in the Gulf of Sirte – an area of sea that Libya claimed as a part of its territorial waters – in August 1981 the U.S. shot down two Libyan Su-22 planes monitoring them. Closing down Libya's embassy in Washington, D.C., Reagan advised U.S. companies operating in the country to reduce the number of American personnel stationed there. In March 1982, the U.S. implemented an embargo of Libyan oil, and in January 1986 ordered all U.S. companies to cease operating in the country, although several hundred workers remained. Diplomatic relations also broke down with the U.K., after Libyan diplomats were accused in the shooting death of Yvonne Fletcher, a British policewoman stationed outside their London embassy, in April 1984. In Spring 1986, the U.S. Navy again began performing exercises in the Gulf of Sirte; the Libyan military retaliated, but failed as the U.S. sank several Libyan ships. question: What did Reagan wrongly believe Libya to be?   \n",
